/**
 * This function closes the connection to the Hypervisor. This should
 * not be called if further interaction with the Hypervisor are needed
 * especially if there is running domain which need further monitoring by
 * the application.
 *
 * Connections are reference counted; the count is explicitly
 * increased by the initial open (virConnectOpen, virConnectOpenAuth,
 * and the like) as well as virConnectRef; it is also temporarily
 * increased by other API that depend on the connection remaining
 * alive.  The open and every virConnectRef call should have a
 * matching virConnectClose, and all other references will be released
 * after the corresponding operation completes.
 *
 * @returns {Number} a positive number if at least 1 reference remains
                     on success. The returned value should not be assumed
                     to be the total reference count. A return of 0
                     implies no references remain and the connection is
                     closed and memory has been freed. A return of -1
                     implies a failure.  It is possible for the last
                     virConnectClose to return a positive value if
                     some other object still has a temporary reference
                     to the connection, but the application should not
                     try to further use a connection after the virConnectClose
                     that matches the initial open.
