/**
 * This function should be called first to get a connection to the
 * Hypervisor and xen store
 * 
 * If @name is None, if the LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI environment variable is set,
 * then it will be used. Otherwise if the client configuration file
 * has the "uri_default" parameter set, then it will be used. Finally
 * probing will be done to determine a suitable default driver to activate.
 * This involves trying each hypervisor in turn until one successfully opens.
 * 
 * If connecting to an unprivileged hypervisor driver which requires
 * the libvirtd daemon to be active, it will automatically be launched
 * if not already running. This can be prevented by setting the
 * environment variable LIBVIRT_AUTOSTART=0
 * 
 * URIs are documented at http://libvirt.org/uri.html
 * 
 * virConnectClose should be used to release the resources after the connection
 * is no longer needed.
 *
 * @param {String} name
