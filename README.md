Node bindings for [Libvirt][libvirt_home]

The bindings are generated from libvirt's exported api

## Stability
Experimental. This library is still under active development and subject to non-backwards compatible changes in any future version. Use of this library is not recommended in production environments until version 1.0.0 is released.

## Pre-requisites
* libvirt-dev must be installed and in your include path
* Node version that supports [napi][napi] >= 8
* gcc installed

## Installation (linux)
Install libvirt-node through npm

    sudo apt-get install libvirt-dev
    npm install libvirt-node

## Usage
    const libvirt = require('libvirt-node');

    let connection = libvirt.open('qemu:///system');
    let domains = connection.listAllDomains(libvirt.VIR_CONNECT_LIST_DOMAINS_RUNNING);
    console.log(`My running domains: ${domains.map(domain => domain.getName())}`);

More examples can be found in the tests

## API
libvirt-node loosly mirrors the official [libvirt docs][libvirt_docs] with minor corrections (mainly without the virModule prefix)

### Coverage
The API is still under development and not all libvirt functions are supported.

The [whitelist][whitelist] has the supported (and not yet supported) functions.

## Development

For development documentation please refer to [DEVELOPMENT.md][development]

## Build in docker container
If you already installed docker locally, you can check build by

    make docker
